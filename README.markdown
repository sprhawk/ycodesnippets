Code Snippets
=============

How to use:
-----------

Just drag it into User Code Snippet Library, at the right side bar of XCode4 (or XCode 3)

If using trackpad/macbook(pro) in 'tap to click' mode, and have trouble in dragging, you can use one finger to press down the trackpad, and use another finger to drag the code snippets.
