Code Snippets
=============

How to use:
-----------

1. Just drag it into User Code Snippet Library, at the right side bar of XCode4 (or XCode 3)

If using trackpad/macbook(pro) in 'tap to click' mode, and have trouble in dragging, you can use one finger to press down the trackpad, and use another finger to drag the code snippets.

2. Edit the snippet name, summary and shortcut.

3. Have a try. 


**Or** just copy the files under codesnippets, to the ~/Library/Developer/XCode/UserData/CodeSnippets/
